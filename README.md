This Python script counts each keystroke on the keyboard.
It's simple I know. I'm a beginner.

The count is saved automatically every 60 seconds in a txt file.
It then prints the date/time, and number of keystrokes.
Written in norwegian, will translate to english.

Not tested:
  If the txt file is created if not present.
